# Physics of Quantum Information Technology

The code of projects in the group Physics of Quantum Information Technology (PQIT) will be published in this repository . 
PQIT is the group of Professor Abolfazl Bayat in the Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences (IFFS) at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). We are based in Chengdu, the beautiful capital of the Sichuan province and home town of pandas, in China. The interdisciplinary research subjects of the group lie at the intersection of quantum technologies, condensed matter physics and computer science. In particular, we are interested to explore strongly correlated many-body systems for applications in quantum information and technologies. The research subjects vary from some very fundamental topics to practical emerging technologies. Our groups is very international with people joining from all over the world.
